#  Stroke Prediction

The purpose of this project is to explore the patient data and train a model that predicts if some patients are in risk for a stroke. 


## Description

We are working with medical data. 
I think that technology and machine learning in specifics, can contribute a lot on improving our lives, including the medical field. 
So I decided to work on medical data, and tackle an important issue: Stroke. 


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python
* joblib==1.2.0
* matplotlib==3.6.3
* numpy==1.24.1
* pandas==1.5.2
* scikit_learn==1.2.0
* seaborn==0.12.2
* streamlit==1.17.0
* Internet Browser

### Installing

* To see and edit the source code, download the project, run Stroke_Prediction.py to execute the web app. Open Stroke_Prediction_Project.ipynb to see how the model is trained. 
* If used only for running the app, no installation is needed. 

### Executing program

* To run the webapp, open Stroke_Prediction.py and run the code. Once you get the interface open, provide the medical parameters and click "Diagnose". 
* The app can also be run through this [link](https://agnesap-stroke-prediction-application-python2-rl37cm.streamlit.app)
